    - Upon implementing Cisco model I'm thinking "Should I move snmpWalk methods inside the Switch interface?
        So I could just do `(manger.getSwById(id)).walk[Mac|IfStatus]` per device?". So...
        Let's see:
            For the generic switches you just walk the mac oid and get results.
            For cisco switches you need to pass vlan number to the community and iterate over vlans.
            For tp-link... Oh... shortly: consider each (brand)model has it's own mac OID.
        So... every model should have it's own mac poller implementation... Yes, It must be done this way.
    - Mentioning "device" above reminded me that the poller could be extended to use any snmpEnabled device e.g wifi router...
    !(BUGS)
        SnmpWalk returns empty result if device is unreachable.
